                <p><strong>Question-01:</strong> What is the difference between var, let and const?</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> The differences between var, let, and const variable
                    declaration in JavaScript include:
                    Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
                    Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be
                    accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
                    Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope
                    to the immediate enclosing block.</p>

                <p><strong>Question-01:</strong> Why we should use template string?</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript
                    released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without
                    needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are
                    complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags.
                    Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are
                    great for converting strings to different entities.</p>

                <p><strong>Question-01:</strong> What is the difference between arrow function and regular function?</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> An arrow function is also known as the fat arrow function. It
                    is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions.
                    Both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner but there are some
                    differences between them. Let's see the differences below: <br>1. A programmer can get the same
                    result as regular functions by writing a few lines of code using arrow functions. <br>2. object
                    inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments. The arrow function, on the opposite,
                    doesn’t define arguments i.e. they do not have arguments binding. <br>3. Inside of a regular
                    JavaScript function, this value is dynamic. The dynamic context means that the value of this depends
                    on how the function is invoked.</p>

                <p><strong>Question-01:</strong> Write down the difference between map, foreach, find, filter?</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Map executes the same code on every
                    element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements. ForEach is used to execute
                    the same code on every element in
                    an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. Function .find() is also a search
                    function like the previous but they differ in one small detail — this function returns only one
                    match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that
                    has matched. Filter checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and
                    returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.</p>
