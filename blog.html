                <p><strong>Question-01:</strong> What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually. The client  can only read local storage. There is no transfer of data to the server. On the other hand, The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB. Itâ€™s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed. The client can only read local storage. There is no transfer of data to the server.</p>

                <p><strong>Question-01:</strong> How does the javascript even loop work?</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.</p>

                <p><strong>Question-01:</strong> What is the difference between global scope and local scope?</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Global variables are declared outside all the function blocks. The scope remains throughout the program. Any change in global variable affects the whole program, wherever it is being used. Global variables are stored in the data segment of memory. On the other hand, Local Variables are declared within a function block. The scope is limited and remains within the function only in which they are declared. Any change in the local variable does not affect other functions of the program. Local variables are stored in a stack in memory.</p>

                <p><strong>Question-01:</strong> How do we get undefined in javascript?</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Undefined is also a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it. So we can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value. You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. If you pass less arguments in function call then, that parameter will have undefined value. An undefined evaluates to false when used in conditional expression.</p>
